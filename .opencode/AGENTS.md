# SDLC Agent Team

A comprehensive team of specialized AI agents covering the full Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).

## Team Overview

This project includes 10 specialized agents that work together to handle all aspects of software development:

| Agent | Role | Mode | When to Use |
|-------|------|------|-------------|
| **orchestrator** | Team Lead | Primary | Default - coordinates all agents |
| **planner** | Solution Architect | Subagent | Requirements, architecture, planning |
| **researcher** | Technical Researcher | Subagent | Technology evaluation, debugging |
| **debug** | Debug Engineer | Subagent | Issue investigation, root cause analysis |
| **fix** | Bug Fix Engineer | Subagent | Implementing bug fixes |
| **reviewer** | Code Reviewer | Subagent | Code quality, security audit |
| **tester** | QA Engineer | Subagent | Test creation, quality assurance |
| **documenter** | Technical Writer | Subagent | Documentation, guides, API docs |
| **git-manager** | DevOps (Git) | Subagent | Version control, branching |
| **devops** | DevOps Specialist | Subagent | CI/CD, deployment, infrastructure |

## Quick Start

### 1. Using the Orchestrator (Recommended)

The orchestrator is set as the **default agent** and will automatically coordinate the team:

```
# Just start opencode
opencode

# Then ask for anything
"I need to add user authentication"
"Help me debug the database connection issue"
"Review the changes in src/api/"
```

### 2. Direct Agent Invocation

You can directly invoke any agent using `@` mention:

```
@planner create a plan for implementing payment processing
@reviewer review the authentication module
@tester create tests for the user service
@documenter document the API endpoints
@git-manager help me create a release branch
@devops set up a CI/CD pipeline
@researcher investigate PostgreSQL vs MongoDB for our use case
@debug investigate why users can't log in
@fix implement the fix for the null pointer exception
```

### 3. Switching Primary Agents

Use **Tab** key to switch between primary agents (orchestrator, build, plan).

## Typical Workflows

### New Feature Development

```
1. "I need to add [feature]"
   → Orchestrator delegates to planner
   
2. @planner creates architecture plan
   → Planner creates detailed design
   
3. @researcher evaluates technologies
   → Researcher provides recommendations
   
4. Implementation (you or build agent)
   
5. @tester creates test suite
   → Tester writes comprehensive tests
   
6. @reviewer reviews code
   → Reviewer provides feedback
   
7. @documenter updates docs
   → Documenter creates/updates documentation
   
8. @git-manager handles merge
   → Git manager manages branches
   
9. @devops deploys to staging
   → DevOps handles deployment
```

### Bug Investigation and Fix

```
1. "There's a bug with [description]"
   → @debug investigates root cause
   → Outputs Debug Report
   
2. @fix implements fix based on debug report
   → Outputs Fix Report
   
3. @tester creates regression tests
   → Outputs Bug List (if any bugs found)
   
4. If bugs found → @fix fixes bugs
   → Repeat until all tests pass
   
5. @reviewer reviews the fix
   → Outputs Issue List (if any issues found)
   
6. If issues found → @fix fixes issues
   → Repeat until review passes
   
7. @git-manager manages hotfix
   → Branch and merge handling
   
8. @devops deploys fix
   → Production deployment
```

### Code Review → Fix Workflow

```
1. @reviewer reviews code
   → Outputs Issue List (ISSUE-001, ISSUE-002, etc.)
   
2. @fix processes Issue List
   → Fixes Critical issues first
   → Then Important issues
   → Outputs Fix Report
   
3. @tester verifies fixes
   → If bugs found → Outputs Bug List
   → @fix fixes bugs
   → Repeat until all tests pass
   
4. @reviewer re-reviews if needed
```

### Test → Fix Workflow

```
1. @tester creates/runs tests
   → If bugs found → Outputs Bug List (BUG-001, BUG-002, etc.)
   → If all pass → Outputs Test Report
   
2. @fix processes Bug List
   → Fixes Critical bugs first
   → Then High, Medium, Low
   → Outputs Fix Report
   
3. @tester re-runs tests
   → Repeat until all tests pass
```

### Release Preparation

```
1. "Prepare release v2.0"
   → Orchestrator coordinates team
   
2. @tester runs regression suite
   
3. @reviewer performs security audit
   
4. @documenter updates all docs
   
5. @git-manager creates release branch and tags
   
6. @devops prepares deployment
```

## Configuration

The team is configured in:
- `opencode.json` - Main configuration
- `.opencode/agents/*.md` - Individual agent definitions

### Customization

You can customize agents by editing their `.md` files:
- Adjust `temperature` for creativity vs precision
- Modify `tools` for access control
- Update `permission` for security
- Change `model` for different capabilities

## Best Practices

### 1. Let Orchestrator Coordinate
Start with the orchestrator for complex tasks - it knows when to involve specialists.

### 2. Be Specific
Provide clear context when invoking agents directly:
```
❌ @reviewer review the code
✅ @reviewer review src/auth/oauth.ts focusing on security and error handling
```

### 3. Chain Agents
Use multiple agents in sequence:
```
@researcher investigate Redis clustering
@planner create implementation plan based on findings
@tester design test strategy for Redis integration
```

### 4. Use for Entire SDLC
The team covers:
- Requirements & Planning
- Design & Architecture
- Development & Implementation
- Testing & QA
- Documentation
- Deployment & Operations
- Maintenance & Support

## Agent Permissions

| Agent | Write | Edit | Bash | Web | Notes |
|-------|-------|------|------|-----|-------|
| Orchestrator | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Full access |
| Planner | ❌ | ❌ | ⚠️ | ❌ | Read-only, safe bash |
| Researcher | ❌ | ❌ | ⚠️ | ✅ | Read-only with web |
| Debug | ❌ | ❌ | ⚠️ | ✅ | Read-only, can run tests |
| Fix | ✅ | ✅ | ⚠️ | ❌ | Can modify code |
| Reviewer | ❌ | ❌ | ⚠️ | ❌ | Read-only for review |
| Tester | ✅ | ✅ | ⚠️ | ❌ | Can write tests |
| Documenter | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | Write docs only |
| Git Manager | ❌ | ❌ | ⚠️ | ❌ | Git operations |
| DevOps | ✅ | ✅ | ⚠️ | ❌ | Config files |

⚠️ = Ask permission, ✅ = Allowed, ❌ = Denied

## Troubleshooting

### Agent Not Responding
Check if agent is properly configured in `.opencode/agents/`

### Wrong Agent Invoked
Be more specific with agent name: `@planner` vs `@plan`

### Permission Denied
Check agent's `tools` and `permission` settings in agent file

## Examples

### Full Feature Request
```
I need to implement a real-time chat feature using WebSockets.
The chat should support:
- Private messaging
- Group channels
- Message history
- File attachments
```

The orchestrator will:
1. Have planner create detailed architecture
2. Have researcher evaluate WebSocket libraries
3. Coordinate implementation
4. Have tester create test strategy
5. Have reviewer audit security
6. Have documenter document API
7. Have git-manager create branches
8. Have devops set up infrastructure

### Quick Task
```
@tester add unit tests for src/utils/validators.ts
```

Tester will create comprehensive tests for the validators.
